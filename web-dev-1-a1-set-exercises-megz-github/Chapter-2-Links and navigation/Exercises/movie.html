            <p>Ted Lasso follows the journey of an American football coach who has no idea about the famous sport "football" or as the American
                likes to call it "soccer", His unconventional coaching style and optimistic demeanor clash with the skeptical players and fans, 
                leading to both humorous and heartfelt moments.</p><!--a paragraph of the plot of the tv series f ted lasso-->

            <p>Ted Lasso not only lives up to all the hype but exceeds it. I absolutely loved this show! 
                I liked it so much that I'll probably watch both seasons again before season 3 comes out, 
                that's how good this show is! Jason Sudeikis is absolutely fantastic as Ted Lasso. 
                He deserves every award he's won for this role. The entire cast is incredible for that matter. 
                I'm glad to see all the love this show gets and all the awards it's been winning. It's much deserved. 
                If you haven't seen this amazing show yet then do yourself a favor and go watch as soon as possible. 
                Just leave yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge it as quickly as you can.</p><!--the first review of the series-->
            
            
            
            <li>"It's a Comedy , not about Soccer Gameplay" by mdc01757</li><!--the tittle of the review and their username -->
            <p>I watched the 1st, 2nd and 3rd episodes and I can't wait for the next seven to air.
                Jason is a true actor/comedian and plays Ted Lasso perfectly. 
                I first expected a Will Farrel type bumbling fool and then realized Ted Lasso is a man of heart and soul, 
                an inspiration to those in despair, a man that brushes off stupidity and keeps everyone around him uplifted with his " Let's go team " approach. 
                The supporting cast fits right in to make the show enjoyable. 
                I personally don't care for soccer but I enjoy the athleticism and skill it takes to succeed. 
                All I want to really say is watch the show and you'll agree it is enjoyable and a breath of fresh air .</p><!--the first review of the series-->
