    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>


    <ol>
        <li>Get your oven ready and preheat the oven for 375˚F</li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife or a mandoline, slice the eggplant, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini
            <br>into approximately ¹⁄₁₆-inch (1-mm)-thick rounds, then set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Make the sauce:
            <br> Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch (30-cm) 
            <br>oven-safe pan over medium-high heat.Sauté the onion, garlic, and bell peppers until soft, about 10 minutes. 
            <br> Season with salt and pepper, then add the crushed tomatoes. Stir until the ingredients are fully incorporated. 
            <br>Remove from heat, then add the basil. Stir once more, then smooth the surface of the sauce with a spatula
        </li>
        <li>Now arrange the vegetables in alternating slices on top of the sauce, 
            <br>working from the outer edge to the center of the pan. Season with salt and pepper. 
        </li>
        <li>Make the herb seasoning: In a small bowl, mix together the basil, garlic, parsley, thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Spoon the herb seasoning over the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover, then bake for another 20 minutes, until the vegetables are softened.</li>
        <li>Serve hot as a main dish or side. The ratatouille is also excellent the next day–cover with foil and reheat in a 350˚F (180˚C) oven for 15 minutes, or simply microwave to desired temperature.</li>
